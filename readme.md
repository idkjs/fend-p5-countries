#Neighborhood Map Project - Udacity Web Development Nanodegree Project

To run:

Download or fork the application from: https://github.com/kaona/fend-p5-countries
then select index.html to start the app.

To use:

Use filter box to filter list items and map markers. Select a list item or map marker to open an info window describing the marker.
In order to limit calls to the weather API, I implemented the ajax request from within the infowindow. This means that your API limit only gets used when you mouseover a location. It also means that you get the weather for that very moment. 

On line 108, the code is not DRY because in order to use the getJSON returned data the contentstring has to be in the
scope of the json request. Got solution from stackoverflow but cant find link now.
